## 1. Rate Limiting (Redis)

### What was implemented

- **Redis-backed rate limiting middleware** in `apps/web/src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts`
- Configurable per-endpoint rate limits (window, max requests, namespace)
- **Fail-open behavior**: if Redis is unavailable, requests proceed (availability > strict rate limiting)
- Rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After`)
- Global default limits for all endpoints

### Key protections

| Endpoint                 | Limit   | Window | Strategy   |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| All authenticated routes | 100 req | 60s    | User-based |
| Login                    | 5 req   | 60s    | IP-based   |
| Task creation            | 30 req  | 60s    | User-based |
| Report generation        | 20 req  | 60s    | User-based |
| User status changes      | 30 req  | 60s    | User-based |

### Defense layers

1. Rate limit check before handler execution
2. Fail-open when Redis is unavailable (logged but allowed)
3. Structured error response: `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with retry timing

### Test coverage: 18 tests

---

## 1b. HTML Sanitization (XSS Prevention)

### What was implemented

- **DOMPurify-based HTML sanitization utility** in `apps/web/src/lib/sanitize.ts`
- Server-side sanitization applied to task descriptions on **create** (`POST /api/tasks`) and **update** (`PATCH /api/tasks/[id]`)
- Client-side sanitization applied in `RichTextViewer` component before `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (defense-in-depth)

### Sanitization strategy

- **Whitelist approach**: Only TipTap-safe tags allowed (`p`, `strong`, `em`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `a`, `pre`, `code`, `blockquote`, tables, headings)
- **Removes**: `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, `onload`), `javascript:` URLs, `data:` URIs, SVG/MathML
- **Preserves undefined sentinel**: Update route only sanitizes when `description` is explicitly provided — avoids inadvertently clearing the field on unrelated updates
- **Defense-in-depth**: Both server-side (on storage) and client-side (on render) sanitization

### Test coverage: 38 tests

---

## 2. CSV Formula Injection Prevention

### What was implemented

- **`sanitizeCsvCell()`** — Prepends `'` to cells starting with dangerous prefixes (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `|`, `\t`, `\r`)
- **`buildCsvRow()`** — Properly escapes cells containing delimiters, quotes, or newlines (RFC 4180)
- **`buildCsv()`** — Combines rows with `\r\n` line endings and BOM for Excel compatibility

### Dangerous prefixes neutralized

| Prefix | Attack Vector                      | Mitigation           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `=`    | Formula execution (e.g., `=CMD()`) | Prepended `'`        |
| `+`    | Formula execution                  | Prepended `'`        |
| `-`    | Formula execution                  | Prepended `'`        |
| `@`    | Formula execution                  | Prepended `'`        |
| `\|`   | CSV injection via concatenation    | Prepended `'`        |
| `\t`   | Tab-prefix injection               | Prepended `'`        |
| `\r`   | Line break injection               | Escaped within cells |

### Test coverage: 44 tests

## 4. CSRF Protection

### Defense-in-depth layers

| Layer | Mechanism                      | Scope                 | Status          |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | `SameSite=Lax` session cookies | All cookies           | ✅ Pre-existing |
| 2     | Origin header validation       | POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE | ✅ New          |
| 3     | Referer header fallback        | When Origin absent    | ✅ New          |
| 4     | Trusted origins configuration  | Via env vars          | ✅ New          |
| 5     | `form-action 'self'` CSP       | All forms             | ✅ Pre-existing |

### Implementation details

- **`validateOrigin()`** — Compares `Origin` header against allowed origins (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` + `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` env vars)
- **`validateReferer()`** — Fallback when Origin is absent (CLI tools, same-origin requests)
- **`csrfErrorResponse()`** — Returns 403 with `CSRF_VALIDATION_FAILED` error code
- Integrated into **`withAuth`** middleware — applies to all mutation methods automatically
- Missing Origin header allowed through (required for same-origin requests and non-browser clients)

### Test coverage: 18 tests

---

## 5. Auth Negative Testing

### What was implemented

#### Pre-login deactivation check

- **`hooks.before.signIn`** in Better Auth configuration queries user `isActive`/`isSuspended` status
- Rejects login attempts from deactivated or suspended users _before_ authentication completes
- Descriptive error messages: "Your account has been deactivated/suspended. Contact your administrator."

#### User status management endpoint

- **`PATCH /api/users/[id]/status`** — supports `deactivate`, `suspend`, `activate`, `unsuspend` actions
- Permission-guarded: requires `user:deactivate` permission
- Organization-scoped validation
- Self-deactivation prevention (cannot deactivate your own account)
- **Session revocation** on deactivation/suspension — deletes all active sessions from database
- Audit-logged with `createAuditEntry()`

#### Protection layers for deactivated users

| Layer | Mechanism                                    | Where             |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1     | Pre-login hook rejects at auth time          | `auth/index.ts`   |
| 2     | `checkUserActive()` in `withAuth` middleware | `api-auth.ts`     |
| 3     | Session revocation on status change          | `status/route.ts` |

### Test coverage: 14 tests

---

## 5b. User Status Management

### What was implemented

- **PATCH /api/users/[id]/status** — supports deactivate, suspend, activate, unsuspend
- Permission-guarded (requires `user:deactivate`)
- Self-deactivation prevention + session revocation
- Audit-logged

## 8. API Route Gap Closure

### What was implemented

- **Projects `[id]` route** — Created `GET /api/projects/[id]` (single project with owner info + task stats + milestones), `PATCH /api/projects/[id]` (Zod-validated update with audit logging), `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` (soft delete). Uses `project:view`/`project:edit`/`project:delete` permission codes.
- **Teams PATCH validation** — `PATCH /api/teams/[id]` now uses `TeamUpdateSchema` for `.strict()` mass-assignment protection instead of manual body extraction.
- **Departments PATCH validation** — `PATCH /api/departments/[id]` now uses `DepartmentUpdateSchema` for `.strict()` mass-assignment protection instead of manual body extraction.

### Configurations added

- `ProjectUpdateSchema` in `lib/api/validation.ts` — covers name, code, description, ownerId, departmentId, teamId, status, priority, progress, startDate, endDate, isActive, tags with `.strict()` protection.

### Impact

- All 20+ API routes now have consistent Zod validation with `.strict()` mass-assignment protection.
- Projects CRUD is now complete (previously missing individual project GET/PATCH/DELETE).

## 9. Health Endpoint Hardening

### What was implemented

- **IP-based rate limiting**: 60 req/min per IP using the same Redis-backed `checkRateLimit` utility as all other endpoints
- **Information disclosure fix**: Changed error messages from `"REDIS_URL not configured"` to `"Caching service not configured"` — prevents leaking internal env var names to unauthenticated callers
- **Rate limit headers**: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` attached to successful responses
- **Fail-open**: Rate limiting fails gracefully if Redis is unavailable

---

## 10. Role-Aware Data Visibility

### What was implemented

Permission checks added to all GET list endpoints that were previously wide-open (org-scoped only):

| Endpoint                     | Permission Required | Scoping                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Permission model design

- All endpoints already had **org scoping** (`WHERE organization_id = ?`) — this is now enforced
- **CRUD permissions** (`module:create`, `module:edit`, `module:delete`) already enforced on mutations
- **Read permissions** (`module:view`) were **missing** on GET list endpoints — now added
- **Tasks** have a three-tier visibility: `task:view` (assigned to me OR created by me OR mentioned) / `task:view_all` (all org tasks)
- The `task:view` scope uses a `WHERE` condition: `assignedTo = user.id OR createdBy = user.id OR user.id = ANY(mentionedUserIds)`
- Mention scope added via new `mentionedUserIds` text array column on the `tasks` table
- Users mentioned in tasks they didn't create and aren't assigned to now see those tasks

## 11. Frontend Error/Loading/Empty States

### Reusable state components

| Component                     | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LoadingSkeleton`             | Animated placeholder cards for data loading             |
| `CardGridSkeleton`            | Grid-friendly loading skeleton for KPIs and cards       |
| `TableSkeleton`               | Table-shaped loading skeleton with headers and rows     |
| `Spinner` / `FullPageSpinner` | Inline and full-page loading indicators                 |
| `ErrorState`                  | Error display with optional retry button and message    |
| `EmptyState`                  | Customizable empty state with icon, message, and action |
| `NotFoundState`               | 404-style not found with back navigation                |
| `ErrorBanner`                 | Inline dismissible error banner                         |

### Pages updated

All 8 pages in the `(dashboard)` route group now have **loading → error → empty → data** state transitions:

- Dashboard, Tasks, Users, Teams, Projects, Reports, Calendar, Settings

### Empty state action buttons wired

All inline empty state text replaced with the reusable `EmptyState` component featuring contextual action buttons:

| Page             | Action                         | Status           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Tasks            | **Create Task** → `/tasks/new` | ✅ Wired         |
| Projects         | New Project                    | 🔒 (coming soon) |
| Users            | Invite Members                 | 🔒 (coming soon) |
| Teams            | Create Team                    | 🔒 (coming soon) |
| Reports          | **View Tasks** → `/tasks`      | ✅ Wired         |
| Settings - Roles | **Create Role** → opens dialog | ✅ Wired         |

All components include accessibility attributes (`role="status"`, `aria-label`, `sr-only` text).

## Remaining Recommendations

### High Priority

None — all critical and high findings resolved.

### Medium Priority

None — all medium priority findings resolved.

### Low Priority

1. **Performance optimization** — The `requirePermission` + `checkPermission` calls in `GET /api/tasks` make two DB round-trips per request. Could be optimized by caching permissions per request or batching the permission check into a single query.
2. **Secrets scanning** — Add `git-secrets` or equivalent to pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental secret commits.
3. **Scheduled vulnerability re-scanning** — Set up a weekly GitHub Actions workflow to re-scan pinned Docker images for newly disclosed CVEs.
